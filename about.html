    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3 style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">My name is Road2SilverEagleMaster or Roady for short and I have been bhopping since 2013. I have experimented with hammer over the years and started to make maps for bhop in 2020, while these were shit it was fun and I have continued to do so. In this time I have made over 100 maps and a few of them are even good.</h3>

    <h2>Mapping Style</h2>
    <h3 style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">My mapping style has always but more of a emphasis on gameplay than aesthetics, While many maps use very basic texturing, detailing and lighting they usually make up for this with unique and sometimes enjoyable gameplay. I also have a tendency to make very challenging maps that only a select handful of players are able to complete such as <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/325367">bhop_4matan</a> which has only been beaten by 3 people (as of may 2023) after being out since 2021. This map also shows my other tendency, which is trying to push the source engine to its limits of what is possible. bhop_4matan uses 100% of the available verticies and adding 1 more block would cause the map not to compile.</h3>
    <h3 style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">This mapping style makes my maps unique as they do not follow the standard method to make a bhop map. This can be seen in maps like <a href="https://momentum-mod.org/dashboard/maps/223">bhop_2shiny2shuckle</a> which is composed of 7 puzzle stages that need to be solved while giving hints along the way. Once this is completed the player can use the solutions to play it as a standard bhop map.</h3>

    <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
    <h3 style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">I would like to thank all those who have helped me with mapping over these years whether it be the basics of detailing to the intricate details of entities in the source engine just so I can have a silly idea work.</h3>
